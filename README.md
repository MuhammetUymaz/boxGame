# boxGame
 A console application game which was made with C++. However, this game is not completed completely. Hence, it includes some bugs which should be fixed.
 I did not add .exe file. You may be able to make this file when you run boxGame.cpp file in DevC++ and so on.
 Please, README file, thanks!
