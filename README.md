# boxGame
 A console application game which was made with C++. However, this game is not completed completely. Hence, it includes some bugs which should be fixed.
 I did not add .exe file. You may be able to make this file when you run boxGame.cpp file in DevC++ or like a program.
 To play game in correct resolution, please set the console screen as 80x30.
 Pressing "S" key can be useful if the game can not be started after clicking Play button.
